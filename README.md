### Tasks

With the joint efforts of **legal experts** and **artificial intelligence experts**, we categorize the Legal Capabilities of LLMs into three levels, ranging from easy to difficult: Basic Information Retrieval (BIR), Legal Foundation Inference (**LFI**), and Cplex Legal Application (**CLA**), totaling 14 foundational tasks. The diagram above shows the structure of these three capability levels.

- Basic Information Retrieval. The capability of LLMs aims to address some fundamental tasks in the field of law that can be directly transferred from NLP, as well as some simple yet crucial pre-tasks in the legal domain. It includes 5 foundational tasks: Legal Article Recommendation (AR), Element Recognition (ER), Named Entity Recognition (NER), Judicial Summarization (JS), and Case Recognition (CR).
- Legal Foundation Inference. This capability aims to test some basic legal applications for LLMs. It includes 6 foundational tasks: Controversial Focus Mining (CFM), Similar Case Matching (SCM), Charge Prediction (CP), prison Term Prediction (PTP), Civil Trial Prediction (CTP), and Legal Question Answering (LQA).
- Legal Foundation Inference. We consider the challenging tasks that LLMs may face, such as complex reasoning in the legal field and aligning with real legal logic. Here, we focus on three tasks: Judicial Reasoning Generation (JRG), Case Understanding (CU), and Legal Consultation (LC).
  
Below is a brief description to each evaluation task.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Criminal Judgment Prediction</td>
    <td>It involves predicting the guilt or innocence of the defendant, along with the potential sentencing, based on the results of basic legal NLP, including the facts of the case, the evidence presented, and the applicable law articles. Therefore, it is divided into two types of tasks: Charge Prediction and prison Term Prediction.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Civil Trial Prediction</td>

    <td>It utilizes the model‚Äôs legal knowledge to address the national judicial examination, which encompasses various specific legal types.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">CLA</td>
    <td>Judicial Reasoning Generation</td>
    <td>It aims to generate relevant legal reasoning texts based on the factual description of the case. It is a complex reasoning task, because the court requires further elaboration on the reasoning behind the judgment based on the determination of the facts of the case. This task also involves aligning with the logical structure of syllogism in law</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Case Understanding</td>
    <td>It is expected to provide reasonable and compliant answers based on the questions posed regarding the case-related descriptions in the judicial documents, which is also a complex reasoning task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Legal Consultation</td>
    <td>It covers a wide range of legal areas and aims to provide accurate, clear, and reliable answers based on the legal questions provided by the different users. Therefore, it usually requires the sum of the aforementioned capabilities to provide professional and reliable analysis.</td>

### Datasets

We have reorganized and constructed the evaluation datasets for the aforementioned tasks based on existing publicly available Chinese legal datasets. These datasets are collectively referred to as the **Legal Evaluation Dataset (LED)**. We present the evaluation datasets for each foundational task.

### Scoring Mechanism

‚≠êÔ∏è socres for each task
<div align="center">

$$
S_{(Task)} = \begin{cases}
    F1 * 100, & \text{If }\quad Task\quad\in\quad Classification \\
    \frac{1}{3}*(R1 + R2 + RL) * 100, & \text{If }\quad Task \quad\in\quad Text\quad Generation \\
    Acc * 100, & \text{If }\quad Task\quad\in\quad NER
\end{cases}
$$

</div>

Currently, our evaluation benchmarks mainly consist of three types of tasks: classification tasks, text generation tasks and named entity recognition. For classification tasks, we use the F1 score. For text generation tasks, we use the average of Rouge1, Rouge2, and RougeL scores. Specifically, for legal Named Entity Recognition tasks, we use the extraction accuracy of legal entities as their score.

üåü Scores for each LLM

For individual LLM, we first calculate the average score of tasks at each level as its legal capability score for that level. Then, we take the average of these three legal capability scores as the final evaluation score for the LLM. Model evaluation scores can be found [here](#Ê®°ÂûãÂæóÂàÜ).

### Run

We will continue to evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on these tasks according to the structure diagram of the 14 foundational tasks. For details, please refer to the [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/daishen/SCULAiW).
